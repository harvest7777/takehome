xxxXXX understanding problem 30m

---==+ agent selection
- choose a llm provider
- each judge has a status
- users can CRUD
{}
- name
- system prompt
- target model name (just like 4o mini or smth)
- active flag

---==+ assigning judges
- assign judger PER question PER queue
  - for each queue, should have quick way to assign judges to each q
  - needs to be persisted
  - how do we uniquely identify a q?
    - by id, q_template
  - how do we uniquely identify an ans?
    - id, q_template 
- saved on assignment

^ what about allowing which fields are included in prompt?
to make this scalable what should we do?
i dont think we should split the data up, if more fields are added in the future it will be hard to maintain

what if we just store the whole json for q/a
when assigning judges, we should be able to edit the question and check off some thing to include in prompt

this just becomes a parsing problem


---==+ parser
should i normalize the data into columns?
lets think through about this

the user should be able to choose what fields are inclued in the prompt
fields look pretty dynamic. there can be many questiuons per submission
but we want to choose judge per question

we shoudl at the ery least include the question and answer in the prompt

the issue is we dont know what other fields there are

lets store each question answer object for sure

dont want it to be super slow
but it doesnhave to be persistent
so how about this. 

when we assign jduges, we auto store in mthe db

when displaying the tasks, we literally go throught he whole file

^ this has some design implications though if its a big file it might be cooked
but the godo thing is all we care about is the judges, and this lets us work with toe original shape of the data which is good
queueing a job will be very fast
we can just store the list of metadata?
for every parsed submission we must jsut store the questino and asnswer

---==+ running judges
- have some backend endpoint that takes the 
  - quesetion, answer, prompt
  - evaluates and returns pass/fail/inc
