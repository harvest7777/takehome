xxxXXX understanding problem 30m

---==+ agent selection
- choose a llm provider
- each judge has a status
- users can CRUD
{}
- name
- system prompt
- target model name (just like 4o mini or smth)
- active flag

---==+ assigning judges
- assign judger PER question PER queue
  - for each queue, should have quick way to assign judges to each q
  - needs to be persisted
  - how do we uniquely identify a q?
    - by id, q_template
  - how do we uniquely identify an ans?
    - id, q_template 
- saved on assignment

^ what about allowing which fields are included in prompt?
to make this scalable what should we do?
i dont think we should split the data up, if more fields are added in the future it will be hard to maintain

what if we just store the whole json for q/a
when assigning judges, we should be able to edit the question and check off some thing to include in prompt

this just becomes a parsing problem



---==+ running judges
- have some backend endpoint that takes the 
  - quesetion, answer, prompt
  - evaluates and returns pass/fail/inc
