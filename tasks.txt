---==+ setup
[x] local supabase
[x] supabase schema

---==+ db crud for agents
[x] create
[x] read 
[x] update 
[x] delete 

---==+ poll from frontend


---==+ assigning judges
design choice: front end polling
- for simplicity and easier setup
- if was in sqs or something youd have to set up sqs instead of just running everything locally

[] first hasv ethe user pick a submission
[] aggregate data to show questions per queue
[] need to show which judge for which question
[] when i assign a judge what happens?
[] it shoudl go into the queue
